* Config Info
Latest Version: 4.0b1
Latest Edit: [2020-04-27 Mon 11:12]

Set of configuration files for a Gentoo Linux + EXWM + zsh setup. Emacs plays
the central role of the whole configuration as it is my window manager (through
EXWM). Zsh is used with oh-my-zsh for simplicity.

An insteller (installer.sh) that uses GNU stow can be used to install the dotfiles
wherever I want.
