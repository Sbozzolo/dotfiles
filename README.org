* Config Info
Latest Version: 1.2
Latest Edit: [2017-06-08 Thu 10:03]

Set of configuration files for a Arch Linux + EXWM + zsh setup. Emacs plays the
central role of the whole configuration as it is my window manager (through
EXWM). Zsh is used with oh-my-zsh for simplicity.

An insteller (installer.sh) that uses GNU stow can be used to install the dotfiles
wherever I want.

* Fixme

  - [ ] Counsel-yank-pop point goes above the screen
  - [ ] Bad behavior of term with C-r
  - [ ] If file already exist it is not possible to open buffer with similar name
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - [X] Second screenshot function
    Fixed in version 1.0.1 ([2017-02-24 Fri])
  - [X] Projector doesn't seem to work (seems related to X)
    Fixed in version 1.0.3 ([2017-02-26 Sun])

    Fixed with org-update

* Wishlist
  - [ ] Make emacs update Arch

        from using the terminal

  - [ ] Switch to a sourcebase usage of Arch via ABS
  - [X] Function to save-as buffers
