# Sensible default settings for Emacs

Emacs is a terrific editor, but its out-of-the-box experience isn't great. Some
of its default settings feel a bit clunky. `sensible-defaults.el` aspires to
help new users configure some of those settings in a simple and modular way
(i.e., it's just a file of functions you can call).

The `sensible-defaults.el` file contains a number of function definitions, any
of which can be called from your `~/.emacs` or `~/.emacs.d/init.el` file.

`sensible-defaults.el` includes settings for:

* Ensuring that files end with newlines,
* Always enabling syntax highlighting,
* Increasing the garbage collection threshold,
* Defaulting line-length to 80 characters,
* Creating parent directories after saving a deeply nested file,
* Making `dired` file sizes human-readable,
* AND MORE!

For good or ill, sensible-defaults doesn't deal with any external packages. It
only tweaks settings built into the editor itself. If you wanna configure
packages, you're on your own.

## Getting started

Emacs reads its initial configuration from either `~/.emacs.d/init.el` or
`~/.emacs`. We suggest using a `.emacs.d` directory so you can keep your
configuration code in more than one file.

Copy `sensible-defaults.el` into your `.emacs.d`. You can also store it in a
separate directory, if you'd like, or symlink it into your `.emacs.d` directory.
Symlinking is nice, since you can clone this repo somewhere and pull down new
changes as they come in!

Load it from your `init.el` with `(load-file "~/.emacs.d/sensible-defaults.el")`
(or some other path, if you put it somewhere else). This evaluates the file.
That shouldn't do anything interesting on its own, though, since the file only
defines functions.

Browse through `sensible-defaults.el` and decide which settings you'd like to
enable. Call those functions in your `init.el`. That's it!

## An Example

Suppose you want to use every setting and every keybinding suggested by
`sensible-defaults`. Your `init.el` should contain the following code:

```emacs
(load-file "~/.emacs.d/sensible-defaults.el")
(sensible-defaults/use-all-settings)
(sensible-defaults/use-all-keybindings)
```

## A More Selective Example

Maybe you just want to increase the garbage collection threshold, show matching
parentheses, and bind the Home and End keys correctly. Kind of a weird set of
choices, but whatevs, it's easy:

```emacs
(load-file "~/.emacs.d/sensible-defaults.el")
(sensible-defaults/increase-gc-threshold)
(sensible-defaults/show-matching-parens)
(sensible-defaults/bind-home-and-end-keys)
```

That's it!
